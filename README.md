#Homomorphic Learning

This is a suite of libraries for manipulating data types and homomorphisms between them.  Most of these data types are machine learning/data mining primitives.  It is home to all of the hackage packages with an hlearn- prefix, plus a bit of other stuff I haven't cleaned up sufficiently to put on hackage.

Unfortunately, documentation here is very sparse.  Not only is this repository under development, but I'm not even sure what this library is ultimately going to look like.  **The best place to look for documentation is the hackage description of the library you want to use.**

Oh, and please ask questions if you have any!
